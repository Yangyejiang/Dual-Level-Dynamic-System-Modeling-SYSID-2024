# Dual-Level-Dynamic-System-Modeling-SYSID-2024
This is the code for IFAC Symposium on System Identification 2024. The description for the LASA data set can be found at https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/deeplearning/ug/maglev-modeling.html, while the neural network approximation of its dynamics is at https://github.com/xiangweiming/ignnv.

# Related tools and software
This toolbox makes use of IGNNV (at:https://github.com/xiangweiming/ignnv) for reachability analysis; UPPAAL 5.0 (at: https://uppaal.org/)) for LTL specification verification.

# Setup
1. MATLAB pre-installed is required.
2. Add the folder "Dual-Level-Dynamic-System-Modeling-SYSID-2024" to the MATLAB workpath.

# Running tests and examples

1. Open .../Dual-Level-Dynamic-System-Modeling-SYSID-2024/Runtest.mlx with MATLAB to execute the scripts for a test run of the angle example.
2. Open .../Dual-Level-Dynamic-System-Modeling-SYSID-2024/RuntestLoopandForms.mlx with MATLAB to execute the scripts for a test run of the ALL lasa examples and generate forms and graphs in Dual-Level-Dynamic-System-Modeling-SYSID-2024/SaveFigure.
